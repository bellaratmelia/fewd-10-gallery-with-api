# fewd-10-gallery-with-api
trying out Spotify and Flickr APIs

- I reused some codes from the fewd-4 interactive gallery, particularly for the lightbox feature.
- The code is not DRY enough, but I'm not sure how to make it really DRY without sacrificing readability. So I suppose right now it'll do.
- Time taken is about 3-4 days. Refining lots of small details.
- tested on: Safari Version 9.1.1 (10601.6.17), Chrome Version 50.0.2661.102 (64-bit) and Firefox Version 46.0.1
